Hey, I am L. Chen, a programmer and love to build any new things,
this is where I mainly want to record things for my self-reflection.

But I will be super happy if anyone can find anything useful here, and feel free to tell me anything
or ask any questions via Email: chenlong888@gmail.com

<!-- In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
